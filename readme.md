I spent time on this data analyzing individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area. I have used Python data science and data visualization libraries to explore the dataset’s variables and understand the data’s structure, oddities, patterns and relationships.

I started my analysis by looking at the structure of the dataset.The main area of interest was what are the factors influencing the trip duration

I have performed univariate exploration, bi-variate exploration and multi-variate exploration
